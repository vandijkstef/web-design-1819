## Opdracht 1
Marijn - Design a Drag-and-Drop interface
How can you optimise a drag and drop interface for a user that can only use his keyboard and has a reduced motor skills?

### Getting started

#### Prerequisites
- Some way to serve static files -or- a recent version of Node
- Some way to compile SCSS

#### Installation and development
The project is running statically from the `drag-and-drop` folder, though an Express/Node based server is included. Start things by using the default `npm install && npm start`.

SCSS compiling isn't done by this server, thus needs to be performed manually.

### Features
- WASD/Arrow navigation
- Spacebar main action

##### TODOS
I like lists

Key-bound stuff:
	- Q: Quickmenu
		- Q: Close
		- W: Move card to Done
		- E: Export/Download data as JSON
		- A: Add/Create/New
		- S: Settings
		- D: Delete pop-up
			- Shift + D: Delete
	- X: Delete pop-up
		- Shift + X: Delete
	- Z: Reverse
		- Shift + Z: Reverse reverse
	- C: Move card one column to the right

Other:
	- Zooming columns
	- Footer content?
	- Focus keys / Display key
	- Set favorites (on numbers?)
	- Controller support?
