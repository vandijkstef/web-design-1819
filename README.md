## Assignment (1.0)
Marijn - Design a Drag-and-Drop interface
How can you optimise a drag and drop interface for a user that can only use his keyboard and has a reduced motor skills?

### Getting started

#### Prerequisites
- Some way to serve static files -or- a recent version of Node
- Some way to compile SCSS

#### Installation and development
The project is running statically from the `drag-and-drop` folder, though an Express/Node based server is included. Start things by using the default `npm install && npm start`.

SCSS compiling isn't done by this server, thus needs to be performed manually.

### User scenarios (1.2.1)
> Fill this out more
- User needs to move a card to a different column

- User needs to edit/update a card
- User needs to delete a card

### Exclusive design principals (1.2.2)
> How am I using them?

### Principals of UI designs (1.3)

### Features
- WASD/Arrow navigation
- Spacebar main action
